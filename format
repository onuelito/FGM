=== The FGM Format ===

 FGM is a custom file format that contains binary data from a 3D mesh for fast loading.
 Using this tool you can convert a .glb file into a binary FGM file. The structure of
 the FGM file is the following :

    [number of meshes] [position] [normals] [texcoords] [indices]   ...       [buffer]
         2 bytes         8 bytes    8 bytes   8 bytes    8 bytes  (mesh n)     

 The first 2 bytes which are a 16-bit unsigned integer represent the number of meshes.
 Following these are the attributes of each mesh that will be repeated in "mesh n" if
 exceeding 1 to represent the other meshes buffer sizes. Finallt the last part, the
 buffer, contains every information about the attributes of the meshes that can be
 typecasted when extracted.
